Ongoing development
This was my second project involving HTML and CSS and I am happy with the result. This time I tried to learn new things so I tried to structure HTML better my first foray into semantic tags and it was the first project where I used flex and pseudo-classes in CSS. I also did a little introduction to Responsive design.

I plan to continue exploring this technology and learning more, so there will definitely be more projects related to it soon.
